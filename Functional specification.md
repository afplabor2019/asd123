# Functional specification
## Current situation
We have already explained the requirement in the specification.
## Desired system
The system is a web application with responsive design, meaning it will work
on computers and phones too. The system is secure and it is accessible only
with correct identification. Personal information is always kept private.
After signing in the teachers can add, modify, or delete questions in the
database. The multiple-choice questions can have one or more correct answers.
The point value of the questions can be set too. The teachers can assemble
their required tests from these questions or generate a test randomly from
the database. In class, they can give access for the students to take the test in the given timeframe. The test results are sent as described in the
requirement specification under the [Reports form the test results](https://github.com/afplabor2019/asd123/blob/master/Requirement%20specification.md#reports-from-the-test-results) paragraph.
## Current business use cases model
As we can see, the teacher has got a lot of work.

## Required business use cases model
As we can see, the teacher has less tasks, thanks to the system.

|    Engine            |    F1     |    Quiz generator         |    0.1        |    The program’s engine will be   able to handle 50 questions without any problem or error. The tests will be   available to students to fill and always in random order. After they done it   the program corrects it and shows the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|    Engine            |    F2     |    Database connection    |    0.1        |    All data will be stored in a   database which will run on a remote server and only the administrator will be   able to change it directly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|    Authentication    |    F3     |    User types             |    0.2        |    The program will differentiate 3   user type. One will be for students with limited rights and only right to   change their password and email address. One for teachers with more rights   and access to the database from the GUI. The last one will be for the   administrator who will have all rights and access to all data in the   database. Also he will be able to add users to the program and change some of   their rights. (e.g.: which students marks will the teachers be able to see)    |
|    Authentication    |    F4     |    Login                  |    0.2        |    From the home page all user will   have the option to log in with an ID and password given to them by the   administrator. All user will have right to change their password after they   logged in but no right to change their name. The program will only have one administrator   at lunch and he will be able to add users.                                                                                                                                                                          |
|    Authentication    |    F5     |    Adding questions       |    0.2        |    Users with at least teacher rights will be able to   add questions to the database from the GUI. Teachers can use questions from   other teachers to generate tests but they won’t have rights to change them,   they can only change what they have added.   Students will be able to see and do all tests, which the teachers allowed   them to see and fill.                                                                                                                                           |

By default it will be empty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
