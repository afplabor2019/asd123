There are different subjects: geography, history, and Hungarian grammar.  
During the year there would be one final exam with fifteen questions, and several pop quizzes with only three questions.  
The teachers can define all the questions by themselves, or they can let the program to generate quiz with random questions from the database.  
All questions can be found in the database by subjects and years.  
The students can receive emails about their results, and the teacher receives statements about all students' results.  
Gradation should be automatic.  
Students can enter the system only with a private ID.
The order of the questions should be random for everyone.  
There would be a report to the high school's headmaster about unsatisfactory exams at the beginning of each month.  
There would be several question types for examples, only one solution is good or even more at once. For each question, teachers can adjust how many points the students can receive in the case of right or wrong answers.
