# Our procejts (DentalWebsiteProject, QuizProject)

These projects were generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.

##Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.jsÂ® and an npm package manager. Angular requires Node.js version 10.9.0 or later, to get Node.js, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Npm package manager
Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages. To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager. We use the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default. To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal/console window.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
