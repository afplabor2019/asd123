        <h1>Requirement specification</h1>
        <h2>Desired system</h2>
        <p> With the system in place, the school can reduce paper usage, and ease the
            teachers' work. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use. The test
            questions and the mode of evaluation can be chosen by the teacher. The
            students get the test in a randomized order, reducing the risk of cheating.
        </p>
        <h3 id="report">Reports from the test results</h3>
        <p>The system immediately evaluates and grades the test, and sends the result
            in an email to the student. Furthermore, the teacher gets a notification
            from the whole class's performance. Lastly, the headmaster gets a list of
            all the failing grades in each month, helping him to identify the students
            who struggle with their studies and need help.</p>
        <h1>Functional specification</h1>
        <h2>Desired system</h2>
        <p>The system is a web application with responsive design, meaning it will work
            on computers and phones too. The system is secure and it is accessible only
            with correct identification. Personal information is always kept private.
            After signing in the teachers can add, modify, or delete questions in the
            database. The multiple-choice questions can have one or more correct answers.
            The point value of the questions can be set too. The teachers can assemble
            their required tests from these questions or generate a test randomly from
            the database. In class, they can give access for the students to take the test
            in the given timeframe. The test results are sent as described in the
            requirement specification under the <a href="#report">Reports form the test results</a> paragraph.
