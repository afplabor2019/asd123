# System plan

## Project plan:
### Project roles and their responsibilities
##### Project Manager
* Who the project manager is:
The project manager plays a primary role in the project, and responsible for planning, organizing, managing, controlling and communicating on all phases of a project. The goal is to complete the project successfully.
* What the project manager does:
The managerâ€™s job is to ensure that the project proceeds within the specified time frame and under the established budget, while achieving its objectives.

## Business process model:
There are two type of business actors in our system: the user, and the manager. The user can request a price list and read the informations on the website. The manager can send the requested price list to the user and change the database on the admin page. With this change, the manager can customise the displayed information on the website, so it has up to date, accurate data all the time.

# Requirements:
For a minimal viable product we have to implement all the functions on the requried functions list, whitch can be seen here: [Required business use cases model UML](https://github.com/afplabor2019/asd123/blob/master/DentalWebsiteProject/Documents/Requirement%20specification.md#required-functions-list)

## Functional plan:
 * ### System actors and use cases:
We distinguish between User and Manager in the system.
These roles detailed description and options for each role
can be found in the functional specification, which is also 
available at the [functional specification](Functional%20specification.md#Use-cases).
 * ### Wireframes:
In the functional specification, we have already discussed the [Wireframes](https://github.com/afplabor2019/asd123/blob/master/DentalWebsiteProject/Documents/Functional%20specification.md#wireframes) of the websites' look, so you can check them there.
