# Functional specification 
## Desired system 
The system is a web application with responsive design, meaning it will work on computers and phones too. On every page, there is a navigation bar. On the landing page, there is a slideshow with pictures of some products the site offers. It circles through the elements automatically, but the user can choose the displayed slide manually too. On the bottom of the landing page, there are the logos of the partner companies.  
On the about us page, the users can find a description of the company and information about the dental staff.  
The products page contains all of the products that are available for purchase. These can be sorted by categories. For each product, a short description and a picture are displayed.  
There is a page where the pictures of previous works can be found.  
On another page, users can find all of the contact information about the company. This page displays the email address, telephone, location, and a price request form. The location is displayed on a map. On the price request form, users can add their email address, and write a message for the manager, asking for a price list.  
Lastly, there is an admin page, where the manager can change the database. This can only be accessible for the manager.
